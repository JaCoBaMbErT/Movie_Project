Of those five (5) available choices, \"bom.movie_gross.csv.gz\" contained financial information and only that, so we discarded it as we could find that information elsewhere. Additionally, \"rt.movie_info.tsv.gz\" and \"rt.reviews.tsv.gz\" were synopses and reviews respectively, and full of strings that would be quite difficult to quantify and proved unnecessary."

The IMDB dataset contained such fare as ratings, directors, and actors. This data spanned from (insert) to (insert). Additionally, we chose to use \"tmdb.movies.csv.gz\". This data came from \"The Movie Database\", and spanned the years 2013 to 2018. We chose this dataset because it contained a rating system, as well as title information."
