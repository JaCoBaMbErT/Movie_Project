Anyway, our company had no real knowledge of what makes a good movie or how to make a movie profitable, so our team was tasked with exploring data and running tests upon that data in order to provide that information and inform our business recommendations.

    "We were provided five (5) data files, from various sources, and our first task was to decide which of those data files were viable for our purposes and which were, for lack of a better word, useless. Of those five (5) available choices, \"bom.movie_gross.csv.gz\" contained financial information and only that, so we discarded it as we could find that information elsewhere. Additionally, \"rt.movie_info.tsv.gz\" and \"rt.reviews.tsv.gz\" were synopses and reviews respectively, and full of strings that would be quite difficult to quantify and proved unnecessary."

The IMDB dataset contained such fare as ratings, directors, and actors. This data spanned from (insert) to (insert). Additionally, we chose to use \"tmdb.movies.csv.gz\". This data came from \"The Movie Database\", and spanned the years 2013 to 2018. We chose this dataset because it contained a rating system, as well as title information."

These figures are very important for mathematical calculations, and answering the question of how much a movie is worth in a quantifiable amount."
